Lab 7: PWM
For Lab 7, there are 6 requested Tasks:

- Lab 7_1:
Simple PWM output at 1KHz frequency

- Lab 7_2:
Three PWM's, each with 120 degrees phase shift

- Lab 7_3:
Simple PWM output at 1KHz, but now the DutyC changes using interrupt

- Lab 7_4:
2 PWM signals complementary to each other, working similar to LAB 3

- Lab 7_5:
2 Independent PWMs, Dutycycle changing via user input

- Lab 7_6:
2 PWMs, but now with a delay between them
